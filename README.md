**This is project where are used some new technologies for me**

<h2>Angular ðŸ›‘</h2>
<h3>This was my first project where I was using Angular framework and here are what I used:</h3>

<ul> 
    <li><strong>Services</strong> - for handling database operations like: getting, reading, changing data from database</li>
    <li><strong>RxJS</strong> - I used it instead of async/await functions in services, for handling async operations</li>
    <li><strong>SCSS</strong> - CSS preprocessor for styling components</li>
</ul>

<h3>I also used such features like: ngFor, ngModel, property bindings, in short, I tried not to use everything I get used to</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Firebase ðŸ”¥</h2>
<h3>Here, I was using firebase for database and user authentication:</h3>

<ul> 
    <li><strong>Firebase realtime database</strong> - for storing data like: users, friend requests, messages</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase realtime database</strong> built-in functions like: <i>ref()</i>, <i>get()</i> <i>update()</i> <i>set()</i> <i>updateProfile()</i></li>
    <li>Authentication using email and password</li>
</ul>
